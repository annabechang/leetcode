Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

Example:

Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
Note:

You may assume that the array does not change.
There are many calls to sumRange function.

the idea is to sum to the j and then minus the sum to before i
for example
sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
sum ~ 5 = -3
sum ~ 1 = -2
-3 - (-2) = -1

class NumArray:

    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):

        for num in nums:
            self.accu.append(self.accu[-1]+num)
        #print (self.accu)
    
    def sumRange(self, i: int, j: int) -> int:

#You may assume that the array does not change.         

# Your NumArray object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = NumArray(nums)
